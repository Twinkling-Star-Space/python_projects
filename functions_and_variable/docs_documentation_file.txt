In this folder we learned about the following data:

functions
-inbuilt functions (input, print)
-human made functions


Variables
return
data types (int, float, str)


str methods
strip()     # remove spaces before and after a word
split()     # it splits a sentence into distinguishable words
title()     # capitalizing the begining of each words
capitalize()  # capitalizing the beginning of a sentence
uppercase()   # converting all the letters into uppercase



projects:

work_1: we completed a small first python project by making a calculator that simply added to int 
number.

work_2: we also managed to solve the user input problems that mistakenly entered spaces or lower case words.




Some of the special syntaces

print(*objects, sep = '', end = '')

round(number[,ndigits])  #rouding off number or digits after decimals

def main():              #conventional method of writing python code
main()



some of the operators:

**   # this allows you to find square of the number
=    # it is called assignment operator

\    # it is a escape character that tells interpreter to let quote unquote inside quote unquote
